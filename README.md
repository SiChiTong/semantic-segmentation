# Semantic Segmentation

üöß this is still under development üèó

Semantic segmentation has become an important component of self-driving vehicles. It allows the car to understand the surroundings by classifying every pixel of the input image.

## Running...
To run inference on the pre-trained models, please use `segmentor.py`. 

	from segmentor import Segmentor
	seg = Segmentor()
	cls_output, img_viz = seg.semantic_segmentation(image=image, visualization=True)

`cls_output` is the pixel-wise classification result for all the categories. `img_viz` is a RGB image generated based on `cls_output`

The best way to run some actual test is using `test.py`. You must specify the image path by changing the `path` variable. 

The pre-trained weights are stored in the `./weights` directory.

## Training

`train.py` is the training script. `utils.py` contains all the categories (classes). You can modify them based on your dataset. 

*training doesn't work very well.* I trying to fix the issue. 

## Models

The goal is to achieve real time semantic segmentation. Therefore, choosing & developing the appropriate model is critical.

### ENet
This is a little bit from their paper:

"*...we propose
a novel deep neural network architecture named ENet (efficient neural network),
created specifically for tasks requiring low latency operation. ENet is up to 18√ó faster, requires 75√ó less FLOPs, has 79√ó less parameters, and provides similar or
better accuracy to existing models. We have tested it on ... datasets and report on comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods,
and the trade-offs between accuracy and processing time of a network...*"

Real-Time Semantic Segmentation" (2016) Adam P., Abhishek C, Sangpil K., Eugenio C

Fore more information, please visit their paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02147.pdf)

The implementation of ENet is done in Keras.
